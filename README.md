# minima-course

Course shell for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) based on [Minima](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme.

Accomodates:

* Home page is course schedule
* Schedule built from `sechedule.yaml` in `_data` directory (easier to maintain)
* Exercises (`_exercises`), Labs (`_labs`), Projects (`_projects`)
* Lecture Notes (`_notes`)
* Sample Code (`_samples`)
* Resources included on Exercises, Labs, and Projects
