In the following exercises, assume 8-bit data types unless otherwise noted.

1. How many values can be represented using a 9-bit binary number?

2. Write decimal value `230` in (a) binary, and (b) hex.

3. Write binary value `0b10001111` in (a) decimal, and (b) hex.

4. Write hex value `0x55` in (a) decimal, and (b) binary.

5. Compute `0x69 | 0x55` (express your answer in hex).

6. Compute `0x69 || 0x55` (express your answer in hex).

7. Compute `5 << 1`, `5 << 2`, and `5 << 3` (express your answers in decimal). What do you notice?

8. C does not provide a logical XOR operator (which you might expect to be `^^`). How could you compute the logical XOR of two ints `x` and `y` using existing logical operators (`==`, `!=`, `||`, `&&`, and `!`)?
